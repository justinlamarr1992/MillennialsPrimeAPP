# Feature Status & Roadmap

## Overview

MillennialsPrimeAPP follows a **progressive feature release** strategy. The application contains fully implemented features that are selectively enabled using feature toggles. This approach allows:

- Development ahead of launch without exposing incomplete features
- Safer, incremental releases
- Faster iteration cycles
- Modular feature rollout based on business priorities

## Feature Toggle Mechanism

### Implementation

Feature toggles are implemented via the `href` property in tab navigation configuration:

**File**: [app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx](<../../app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx>)

```typescript
<Tabs.Screen
  name="(social)"
  options={{
    href: null,  // 🚫 Hidden from tab bar
    // tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <TabBarIcon name="people" color={color} />,
    // title: "Social",
  }}
/>
```

**To Enable a Hidden Feature:**

1. Remove the `href: null` line
2. Uncomment the `tabBarIcon` and `title` properties
3. Test thoroughly in development
4. Deploy via app update

## Business Considerations

### Why Progressive Rollout?

**Benefits**:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Test features with smaller user groups before full release
2. **Resource Management**: Focus development resources on priority features
3. **User Experience**: Avoid overwhelming users with too many features at once
4. **Quality Assurance**: More thorough testing of individual features
5. **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback on each feature before adding more

### Feature Prioritization Criteria

Features prioritized based on:

1. **User Value**: Impact on core user experience
2. **Technical Complexity**: Development and testing effort required
3. **Dependencies**: External integrations and infrastructure needs
4. **Business Goals**: Alignment with company objectives
5. **Market Timing**: Competitive landscape and market demand
